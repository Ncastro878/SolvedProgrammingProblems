# SolvedProgrammingProblems
Various coding problems(Data Structures/Algorithms) I've solved form misc. websites

This is a directory & compilation of the programming problems I've solved while learning. I've used lots of different 
websites(HackerRank, CodingBat, TopCoder, etc). I'll try sorting things by website, and then inside those
directories by category(BFS, sorting, Heaps, String Manipulation, etc). 

There's a few reasons I'm doing this. 
- To keep track of problems/types I've solved
- Review old coding habits/styles for improvement in the future
- Review old concepts & how I learned/solved them
- Practice committing and maintaining a git/github repo
- Have problems to show other friends/programmers/employers for critiques or assessment
