'''
	Bubble sorter: My process - Loop through len of list and have counter for total swaps as well as local swaps(new_swaps)
	through each individual pass. When no local swaps are made on a thorough pass through, then the list is sorted and
	we break out the loop. the local swaps variable is reset to 0 on each new pass, so if it stays 0 then the list is sorted.
